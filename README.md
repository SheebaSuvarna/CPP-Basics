# C++ Basics

C++ is a powerful, flexible, general-purpose programming language that supports a number of different coding paradigms, including object-oriented, procedural, functional, and generic programming.

C++ is a compiled language. The compilation process involves several steps:

**source code > preprocessor > Compiler > Linker > Run**
1. **Preprocessor**: Combines source files and header files into a single file. The output is called a translation unit.<br>
2. **Compiler**: Takes the source code from each translation unit and compiles it into object code.<br>
3. **Linker**: Takes all the object files, resolves all the interdependencies, and combines them into an executable file.<br>

## Input and Output

**<iostream>** ----> cout/cin - safer than printf<br>
**<cstdio>** -------> printf/scanf - smaller and faster<br>
**getline()** -----> to input multiple words/ string with space<br>
